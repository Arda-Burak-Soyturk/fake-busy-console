# Fake Busy Console (Python 3)

A modular, extensible **fake command-line interface simulator** written in Python. This project was built to simulate a system console performing various complex-looking tasksâ€”ideal for demonstrations, entertainment, decoy operations, or showcasing terminal UI design.

## Purpose

This project was developed as part of my programming portfolio to demonstrate my skills in:

- Python 3 scripting
- Modular architecture
- Terminal UI simulation
- Class-based extensibility
- CLI tool development

It is also intended for users who need a **fake busy terminal**, **Python-based spinner tool**, or a **command-line UI demo** that appears convincingly active.

## Use Cases

- Simulating activity on an idle terminal
- Creating visual decoys or distractions
- Demonstrating terminal-style animations
- Generating fake system diagnostics output
- Stress-free CLI UI design practice

---

## Features

- Modular, class-based architecture (easy to extend or modify)
- Dynamic task generation (IP scanning, encryption, diagnostics, etc.)
- Customizable spinner animations
- Static + randomized task pipelines
- Optional duration-limited execution
- Works on Windows, Linux, macOS (cross-platform)
